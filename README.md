  Welcome to EEG_Oddball_BIDS by Mark Nelson, a project in the BrainHackSchool 2020. For this project I will be working with an existing EEG dataset collected from 1000 participants while performing a
3-stimulus oddball detection task. The goals of this project are:

(1) Organize an existing EEG dataset according to the BIDS standard and publish in a git repository
(2) Write a python based machine learning algorithm to predict behvaioral measures (object recognition) from single trial ERP amplitude recorded at stimulus encoding
(3) Analyze data for indidividual differences across participants and plot results using custom python based plotting scripts

  This is a work in progress and will be updated daily...
